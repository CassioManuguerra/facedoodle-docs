We had the chance to realize this project into the SPOT building, hence we had access to a lot of different machines (trainings and supervision were required).
As a result **we would like to thank the SPOT and SKIL assistants and coaches, Prof. Cristoph Koch, Federico Stella, Juliette and the rest of CS-358 teaching team that made this project possible.**
