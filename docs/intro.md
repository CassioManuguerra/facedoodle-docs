# Overview

Help impaired people (reduced arm and hand functioning) draw physical images.

FaceDoodle is more than just a 2D plotter. It's an augmented 2D plotter that uses advanced face tracking technology to draw complex lines and shapes using only face movement! Your imagination is its only limit.  It is the combination of a regular 2D plotter and a face tracking drawing interface measuring the angular movements of the face and representating them by a cursor on a screen.

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to get this plotter up and running from A to Z.

We had the chance to realize this project into the SPOT building, hence we had access to a lot of different machines (trainings and supervision were required).
As a result **we would like to thank the SPOT and SKIL assistants and coaches, Prof. Cristoph Koch, Federico Stella, Juliette and the rest of CS-358 teaching team that made this project possible.**
